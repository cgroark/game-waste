Sort It Game

Game Requirements

    Show random image
    Only allow image to dissaper into appropriate bin
    Regenerate with new random image when first image sorts properly
    Pop up screen with more options if trash/rec/comp is not correct and "other" is selected
    Create Timer
    Create score and high score saved in local storage
    
Technology

    JQuery
    Bootstrap
    css animate cdn
    
Overall Approach

    Start with basic html and learn how to make drag/drop items talk to each other
    Build out arrays for all items and then for each set of correct items (trash, rec, compost, other) with additional array for four           "other" options(thread, ewaste, transfer, haz)
    Create logic for random image generation and repopulation
    Create logic for matching images to arrays of correct image
    Build in timer, score and high score saved in local storage

Issues

    Increase comfort with JQuery
    Getting images to populate randomly and be draggable each time they appear
    Getting more than one div to be droppable
    "win" logic to make sure only correct items go to appropriate bin
    Getting all the transitions between pop-ups to be smooth
    bugs with images getting stuck and appearing after game was over
    
Next Steps
    build for responsiveness
    additional items and styling
